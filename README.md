-  Search for a contact by name 
-  Delete contacts by name 
-  Display all contacts sorted alphabetically
-  Handles full phone book scenario 


 File Structure

- `phonebook.c`: Main source code file containing the full implementation

## Requirements
- GCC or any standard C compiler
- A terminal or command-line interface


Data Structures Used
● Using arrays and lists to store contact information
● Use of selection sort for efficient storage, and searching algorithms to store contact details in an order


Challenges Faced
-To efficiently sort the contacts was a big challenge 
-Using of appropriate searching algorithm to find the contacts in the phonebook is the another challenge

Conclusions And Learnings
-Data structures plays a vital and crucial rule from small projects like this to organization level programmes
-I learnt the interface of a simple phonebook which I use daily
